## Overview

AmyGB has evolved from providing an end-to-end e-mail automation system to offering a fully comprehensive [intelligent document processing (IDP) platform](https://www.amygb.ai/intelligent-document-processing). Gen AI-powered VisionERA analyzes and learns about each document, thereby saving workers a lot of time. Plus, VisionERA utilizes IDP that is free of any third-party dependency. VisionERA works in three steps: decode, decipher and decide. During the decode stage, it [extracts data](https://idp-software.com/capabilities/extraction/) from a wide variety of resources, including hard copy or scanned documents. Next comes decipher, which enables companies to verify data according to their specific needs. Finally, the decide stage enables integration and allows vital information to be shared with others.

AmyGB works with a variety of industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, BFSI and retail. It also offers several industry solutions, ranging from vehicle RC verification to bank account verification. It has grown from a company of three in 2017 to employing more than 20 workers.
