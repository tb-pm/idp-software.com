## Overview

IDP software vendor Alphamoon has made it easy for users to pull data from invoices, records, receipts, emails, contracts, and more, thanks to its AI-powered [IDP tool](https://alphamoon.ai/feature/ai-ocr/). With just a few clicks, users can save time, labor, and money by processing documents through Alphamoon's cloud IDP services, pulling data from emails and other sources, and digitizing documents for easier storage, greater accessibility, and more convenient sharing.

## Use Cases

### Finance 

Not only is manual data entry time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it can also introduce human error, which is often expensive to correct. Using AI OCR reduces the risk of errors and streamlines the data entry process, making everything from accounts payable and receivable processes and invoices to vendor details and line item data simple and easy to extract and transfer as needed.

### Logistics

Effortlessly track shipments with the help of Alphamoon document automation. OCR can also help manage supply chain processes, enhance logistics, and [extract data](https://idp-software.com/capabilities/extraction/) from various documents, including customs forms, delivery notes, waybills, and more.

### Healthcare

OCR simplifies the process of converting physical records into digital records to improve patient care and satisfaction. Alphamoon's technology quickly and accurately scans paper documents to create readily accessible digital documents for easy retrieval of patient information, accurate billing, and streamlined processes.
